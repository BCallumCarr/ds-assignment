# ds-assignment

## Initial EDA

The notebook folder contains a Jupyter notebook where the initial EDA on the `users` and `activities` datasets (not committed to this repo) was performed.

The logs contain the answers to the assignment, and the graphs are displayed in the notebook.

## Productionising the process

The notebook code was replicated in standalone Python files which automatically output answers to a txt file and graphs to pngs, based on the data in the data folder.

The `users` and `activities` datasets can be updated in the data folder, and the `run_analysis.exe` can be run to automatically analyse the new data, so long as the schema of the data is the same.

## Testing

Feature to be implemented: Implement testing and validation to ensure new data loaded into data folder is processed correctly.
